(Spreadsheet)\r\n- Who is the owner and who holds responsibility of the asset. (Spreadsheet)\r\n- Current status of the asset such as who has it, last user of the asset. (Paperwork using a Device Register)\r\n- Date & Time of the asset CheckIn/CheckOut Details. (Paperwork using a Device Register)\r\n\r\nHere is the list of problems with this process.\r\n- No Control over the Spreadsheet info. Can't rely on this for concrete info.\r\n- Paperwork is not reliable and maintainable\r\n- Can't find the status of a asset quickly, without having access to the Device Register.\r\n- If Device Register is gone, we loose all the details and historical data.\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\nThe proposed solution is to track the assets through asseTrack - a Web Application.\r\nNote that the solution is about automating the tracking process; not automating the secured way of CheckIn/CheckOut process.\r\n\r\n### Proposed Features\r\n\r\nHere is the list of features proposed for asseTrack.\r\n\r\n| Features |\r\n| :------------- |\r\n| Create an Asset |\r\n| Create a User |\r\n| See List of Assets and their status |\r\n| See List of Users and the details of the assets they have |\r\n| Historical data of the CheckIn/CheckOut process of all assets |\r\n| Search an asset based on Brand(Apple, Samsung), Platform(iOs, Android, Blackberry), Availability(CheckedIn/CheckedOut) |\r\n| Search a user based on UserName, Project Name(DTO,ESP,V4), Practice(QA,Dev,AEM) |\r\n| Create alerts to notify the availability of the device |\r\n| Authentication using oAuth(Google for MVP); Email Authentication for Final product |\r\n| DashBoard to show the following details |\r\n| No of Available devices (8/10) |\r\n| List of users who didn't return the device. |\r\n| Send an alert to the admin and the respective user, when an asset is not returned by EOD. (Push Notification) |\r\n| Display battery status of the device using BatteryAPI |\r\n| Notify When a device is available |\r\n| Preference to allow one user to checkout on behalf of another user |\r\n\r\n### Constraints/Dependencies\r\n- User has to CheckOut through asseTrack when he takes an asset for usage.\r\n- User has to CheckIn through asseTrack when he returns an asset.\r\n\r\n## MVP\r\nThe task is to create a MVP(Minimal Viable Product) in 32 Hours, which should have the MVP features listed here.\r\n\r\n| Features | Due Date | Status |\r\n| :------------- | :------------- | :------------- |\r\n| Create an Asset |21-Dec |✓|\r\n| Create a User |21-Dec|✓|\r\n| See List of Assets and their status |22-Dec|✓|\r\n| See List of Users and the details of the assets they have |22-Dec|✓|\r\n| CheckOut an Asset |22-Dec|✓|\r\n| CheckIn an Asset |23-Dec|✗|\r\n| Historical data of the CheckIn/CheckOut process of all assets |23-Dec|✗|\r\n| Search an asset based on Brand (Apple/LG), OS (iOs/Android), Availability |23-Dec|✗|\r\n| Search a user based on UserName, Project(DTO,ESP), Practice(QA,Dev) |24-Dec|✗|\r\n| DashBoard to show, No of Available devices (8/10)| 24-Dec | ✗ |\r\n\r\nBecause of the time constraint, few of the features won't be available for MVP.\r\n\r\n\r\n### List of Tasks\r\n- UI Widgets Creation\r\n- Responsive Pages\r\n- Firebase DB Setup - Security rules.\r\n- Data Migration from Spreadsheet to Firebase\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
